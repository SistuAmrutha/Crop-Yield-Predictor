# Crop-Yield-Predictor

Our project, Crop Yield Predictor, focuses on using machine learning techniques to estimate crop yields in advance. Farmers today often rely on traditional methods, personal experience, or basic government reports, which may not always be accurate due to changing climate conditions and limited data usage. By combining weather parameters (like rainfall and temperature), soil properties, and even satellite observations, our system can generate more reliable and timely predictions. This helps farmers decide what crops to plant, when to sow, and how to manage resources effectively. Compared to current practices, it reduces uncertainty, minimizes financial risks, and supports insurance schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Looking forward, this project has the potential to bring smarter agriculture, improve food security, and support sustainable farming practices for future generations.
